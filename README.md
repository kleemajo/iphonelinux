1. Compiling
---------------------------------------------------
**Build an ARM toolchain (only needs to be done once):**

`sudo toolchain/build-toolchain.sh make`
	
Wait, for a long time, as the toolchain is compiled.

**Compile OpeniBoot:**

To run openiboot from the recovery mode (a.k.a iboot), youâ€™ll need to create an img3 image.
You will need a system capable of running x86 Linux binaries (Build requires libusb, libreadline and pthread). If compiling on 64-bit linux, you may need libc6-dev-i386 and type export ARCH=x86_64 before you proceed with the next steps, All community builds are run on an Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx system.

Change into the openiboot subfolder

**For iPod touch, run:**
`PLATFORM=IPOD make openiboot.img3`

**For iPhone 2G, run:**
`PLATFORM=IPHONE make openiboot.img3`

**For iPhone 3G, run:**
`PLATFORM=3G make openiboot.img3`

**Compile all in tools/client/:**
`cd tools/client/linux && make all && cd ..`

- The linux client will also build on OSX with the correct libusb version installed.

2. Installing
---------------------------------------------------
**Copy openiboot.img3 into tools/client/linux**

**Put your phone into recovery mode**: hold home whilst powering on until you see the iTunes logo.

**Run:** 
`sudo tools/client/linux/loadibec openiboot.img3`

You should now see openiBoot on your phone, use the volume buttons to scroll to the console icon, then press home

**Run the client:**
sudo client/linux/oibc

*NOTE: If you are on a mac, you will most likely need to do this as soon as you have selected the console - Linux does not manifest this issue.*

You should now see the same output on your computer, as is on your phone's screen.

**Type**: 
`install` and press return

This will take a while, your NOR will be backed up during this process, and can be found in the current directory as norbackup.bin but will flash openiBoot to your phone.

3. Installing multitouch firmware
--------------------------------------------------
A. iPhone 3G user:

   1. Convert zephyr2.bin
 *  Go to "openiboot/mk8900image"
 *  From "openiboot/mk8900image" execute this command (please adjust path to your firmware location): 

	>mk8900image zephyr2.bin zephyr2.img3 template-3g.img3

 *  Using your favorite hex editor, edit "zephyr2.img3"
     change data at offset 0x10 to 0x13 from *cebi* to *2ztm* and save it.

   2. Installing zephyr2.img3
*   Run oibc executable
*   From oibc prompt send "zephyr2.img3" to your iphone (default address is 0x09000000):

	>!zephyr2.img3

	It will return this: file received (XXXXX bytes).

*   Install the firmware from the address and with the size the upload command returned:

    >multitouch_fw_install 0x09000000 XXXXX


B. iPhone 2G user:

   1. Convert zephyr_aspeed.bin and zephyr_main.bin
*   Go to "openiboot/mk8900image"
*   From "openiboot/mk8900image" execute this command (please adjust path to your firmware location): 

	>mk8900image zephyr_aspeed.bin to zephyr_aspeed.img3 template.img3

*   Using your favorite hex editor, edit "zephyr_aspeed.img3"
     change data at offset 0x10 to 0x13 from *cebi* to *aztm* and save it.

*   From "openiboot/mk8900image" execute this command (please adjust path to your firmware location): 

	>mk8900image zephyr_main.bin to zephyr_main.img3 template.img3

*   Using your favorite hex editor, edit "zephyr_main.img3"
     change data at offset 0x10 to 0x13 from *cebi* to *mztm* and save it.

   2. Installing firmwares
*   Run oibc executable
*   From oibc prompt send "zephyr_aspeed.img3" to your iphone (default address is 0x09000000):

	>!zephyr_aspeed.img3

     It will return this: file received (XXXXX bytes).
*   From oibc prompt send "zephyr_main.img3" to your iphone, in this case we will copy to memory location next to zephyr_aspeed.img:

	>!zephyr_main.img3@0x09000000+XXXXX

     It will return this: file received (YYYYY bytes).

*   Install the firmware from the address and with the size the upload command returned:

	>multitouch_fw_install 0x09000000 XXXXX 0x09000000+XXXX YYYYY
